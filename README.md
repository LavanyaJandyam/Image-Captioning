# Image Captioning with VGG16 and LSTM

This repository contains code for an image captioning model using VGG16 and LSTM.

## Environment Setup

### Libraries
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pickle
- tqdm

### Data Preparation
- *Image Features*: Extracted using VGG16 and saved in a pickle file.
- *Captions*: Cleaned by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and adding start/end tokens.

## Model Architecture

1. *Encoder (CNN)*: VGG16 extracts image features.
2. *Decoder (RNN)*: LSTM generates captions from image features and previously generated words.

## Training

- Encode text data and split the dataset.
- Train the model using an optimizer and loss function over multiple epochs.

## Evaluation

- *Caption Generation*: Starts with "startseq" and ends with "endseq" or maximum length.
- *Performance*: Evaluated using BLEU score.
